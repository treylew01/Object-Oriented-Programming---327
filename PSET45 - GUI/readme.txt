HELLO TO WHOEVER IS READING THIS

Was unsure as to what to do for arguments. So in order to run it you simply type in "python main.py chess"
From there a popup will indicate what to pick.
I will say that only the most basic chess works, human vs human, history off, no graphics

When I run the AI vs. Human, or AI vs AI the GUI freaks out so for the sake of your troubles I have disabled that feature - i.e it only works for basic chess human vs human, history off, no Graphics
Happy playing!
